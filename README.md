# ScheduleApp
NetBeans Desktop Schedule App

/*
This desktop application was designed and built to maintain customer records as well as schedule appointments for company consultants.  
It was required that the application convert all appointment times to the current time zone regardless of the userâ€™s login location.  
The backend design had to conform to an existing database structure as the database provided was also used by other systems 
and could not be modified.  
The project was constructed using NetBeans and SceneBuilder.
